    "Write your own code to estimate the transition probabilities and the emission prob- abilities of an HMM, on the basis of (tagged) sentences from a training corpus from Universal Dependencies. Do not forget to involve the start-of-sentence marker ⟨s⟩ and the end-of-sentence marker ⟨/s⟩ in the estimation.\n",
    "The code in this part is concerned with:\n",
    "- counting occurrences of one part of speech following another in a training corpus, \n",
    "- counting occurrences of words together with parts of speech in a training corpus, \n",
    "- relative frequency estimation with smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the lectures, smoothing is necessary to avoid zero probabilities for events that were not witnessed in the training corpus. For emission probabilities, implement Witten-Bell smoothing for unigrams, exactly as on slide 23 of Lecture 5 (use 100000 as value of z). This means that we have one smoothed probability distribution over words for each tag. For transition probabilities, implement Witten-Bell smoothing for bigrams of tags, exactly as on slide 22 of that same lecture (and this in turn will make use of Witten-Bell unigram smoothing that you will have implemented before). To be clear: do not use any existing implementations of Witten-Bell, but make your own, based on your understanding of the lecture notes.\n",

    "Further write your own code to implement the Viterbi algorithm, which determines the sequence of tags for a given sentence that has the highest probability. To avoid underflow for long sentences, we need to use log probabilities. Implement code to compute accuracy of POS tagging (the percentage of correctly predicted tags)."
